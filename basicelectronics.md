## Binary Code and digital signals
- Modern computers use binary digital input (usually binary) to represent all information
- Binary code has two values, 1 representing on/high, and 0 representing off/low
- On is usually 3 or 5 volts while off is usually 0 volts
- Analog devices allow for any value within a given range but are succeptible to noise, binary systems are not greatly affected by noise

## Analog signals
- Analog signals have a continuously changing value and are used ot represent continuous data
- Examples include:
    - Temperature
    - Acceleration
    - Humidity
    - Light Intensity
    - Sound Level
- Examples of digital/discreet signals include:
    - Switch
    - Keyboard switch

## Sensors
- Analog sensors measure analog data, digital sensors measure digital data
- Analog sensors give analog voltage as an output. The output voltage may be anywhere in the range of 0V to 5V (not limited to)
- Analog sensors would include:
    - Thermometers
    - Pressure sensors
    - Light intensity sensors
- Digital sensors would include:
    - Proximity sensors, IR sensor, digital temperature sensor and digital humidity sensor

- A digital sensor consists of 3 components:
    - Sensor
    - Cable
    - Transmitter

- In digital sensors, the signal measured is directly converted into digital signal output... continue later
