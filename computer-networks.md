# Computer Networks

## Adventages

## Disadvantages
- Expensive
- Complex to manage

## Network Node
- A physical device that's part of a network

## Modem
- MOdualtor DEModulator
- Enables a computer to transmit data over telephone lines
- converts digital data from computers to analogue 

## Repeater
- Each type of cable (copper, fibre-optic. etc) has a maximum usable length
- It weakens if it goes over, thats what the repeater fixes

## HUB
- hardware device used to connect computers via ethernet cables to share packets, has a repeater
- every packet is duplicated and sent to every computer. its a security risk and bandwidth killer
- cheap easy but can only sent one packet at a time

## Network Bridge
- joins HUB's together

## Switch
- replaced hubs and bridges
- connects devices together and stores the addresses of all devices that are connected to it
- the swtich only sends the incoming packets to the designated recipient
- only transimt data within a network
- requires a router
- allows Virtual Networks to be made

## Router
- transfers data from one network to another in an inteligent way.
- When a packet arrives, it reads the destination and sends it along

## Gateway
- connects networks that have different protocols
