# Computer Networks

### Adventages

### Disadvantages
- Expensive
- Complex to manage

### Network Node
- A physical device that's part of a network

### Modem
- MOdualtor DEModulator
- Enables a computer to transmit data over telephone lines
- converts digital data from computers to analogue 

### Repeater
- Each type of cable (copper, fibre-optic. etc) has a maximum usable length
- It weakens if it goes over, thats what the repeater fixes

### HUB
- hardware device used to connect computers via ethernet cables to share packets, has a repeater
- every packet is duplicated and sent to every computer. its a security risk and bandwidth killer
- cheap easy but can only sent one packet at a time

### Network Bridge
- joins HUB's together

### Switch
- replaced hubs and bridges
- connects devices together and stores the addresses of all devices that are connected to it
- the swtich only sends the incoming packets to the designated recipient
- only transimt data within a network
- requires a router
- allows Virtual Networks to be made

### Router
- transfers data from one network to another in an inteligent way.
- When a packet arrives, it reads the destination and sends it along

### Gateway
- connects networks that have different protocols

## Types of networks
### Personal Are Network
- created by a person or individuals. cimputer phone etc

### LAN
- limited area, e.g. school
- uses cables or bluetooth, and stuff

### Wide Area Network
- collection of LAN's spread over large area, including countries
- e.g. ATMs

## Network Topology
### Physical Topology
- Map of cables and PC's and how they connect

### Local Topology
- Shows data transfer and network communicatiosn

### Bus Topology
- all connected to a backbone cable, sends a message to all devices with a destination address, like the HUB

### Star Topology 
- Central node, often switch is used to direct data through the network, uses MAC addresses

### Mesh Topology
- All devices are connected
- fiund with wifi
- not a hub or switch, they are all connected

### Ring Topology
- all devices conected to 2 devices
- data travels through each neighbour(one-way system) until it reaches the intended recipient
- every device acts as a repeater
